# RSEcon Workshop Planning

* **Title:** Should describe what your submission is about (max 50 words)  
  From code to contributions: exploring open source culture in academia  
     
* **Abstract**: A brief and attention-grabbing summary of your submission. (max 250 words)

"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a code repository with an open source license must be in want of an extra maintainer." \- Jane Austen, probably. 

While academic researchers and research technical professionals rely heavily on open source tools and software, and open research policies increase the amount of codebases available globally, contribution patterns remain uneven, with maintenance work often undervalued within academic reward structures. This workshop forms part of a larger 2025 SSI Fellowship projecct examining the current culture of open source contributions in the academic landscape and considering opportunities to incentivise, reward, and recongise the collective work of maintaining 

Participants will share personal experiences of open source contributions, and collectively analyse barriers to sustainable participation. They will also hear from groups currently working to actively promote open source contributions at their organisations, before brainstorming and developing practical proposals for effective support for open source contributions within academic settings. 

Participants will leave with both individual action commitments and collective strategies to enhance the recognition, support, and sustainability of open source contributions in academic environments. 

* **Prerequisites**: Describe the required skills or knowledge for an attendee to fully engage with your submission.  
  * Have you considered how accessible your session will be to a diverse conference audience (attendees comprise people from academia, industry, charity and government, from beginners to experts)? (max 150 words)

This session is suitable for any attendees who are aware of open source scientific software concepts including licensing, contributions, maintenance, and recognition for research outputs. No prior technical knowledge is assumed. 

* **Outcomes**: How will your attendees benefit from your session? What do you expect them to gain/learn? (max 150 words)

Participants will develop a more sophisticated understanding of the challenges, motivations, and opportunities to encourage open source contributions across the academic landscape.   
Findings from the workshop will be used to produce a policy briefing for funders, institutions, and government to advocate for better support for open source in research funding. All participants will have the option to be listed either in the acknowledgements or as an author with further input to the written document.   

* **Technical Plan:** Please answer the following questions:  
  * How will you deliver the Workshop?  
  * If you are delivering the Workshop in-person, how will you support attendees both in-person and online?  
  * If you are delivering the Workshop online, how will you support online attendees, and how can the organisers best support you with the in-person aspect?  
  * Bearing in mind that you will have both in-person and online attendees, how many could you reasonably deliver your Workshop to?  
    *   
  * What software and/or tooling will you be providing access to?  
  * What will attendees need to install in advance or bring along (e.g. a piece of their own code)?

**Accessibility**: Please comment on how you will ensure your content is accessible, which may include referring to relevant sections of the [conferenceâ€™s accessibility guidance](https://rsecon25.society-rse.org/conference-policies/accessibility/), as well as any other considerations. Some key pieces to consider are:

* Presenters will be asked to verbally describe their appearance when they first speak   
* Automatic transcription for Zoom will be enabled to support those who use captions to follow the session   
* Platforms used will be selected with consideration for screenreader accessibility, and with several different contribution options to enable people to engage in the way that they prefer or find easiest  
* The workshop presentation will meet accessibility guidelines in terms of font style and colour choices, images will have alt-text that meets government guidelines ([Content design: planning, writing and managing content \- Images \- Guidance \- GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/images))  
* A break mid-workshop will also support those who need a cognitive or comfort break


**Hybrid delivery:** How will you ensure that both remote and in-person participants have an equal experience? Is there anything that might pose a challenge to streaming your proposal? We appreciate that you may not have answers for all considerations at the moment; this is for the organisers to be aware in advance and support you to deliver a successful thing.

* Designate at least one facilitator to facilitate online discussions  
* Shared digital infrastructure for documenting contributions means that online contributions will be valued similarly to in-person contributions  
* Online contributors will be prioritised feeding back to the group as part of share outs and discussions to ensure their voices are heard   
* Currently do not anticipate challenges beyond possibly connectivity in preventing online participants from fully engaging 

You will also be asked to provide:

* **Author list:**   
  * Arielle Bennett, Senior Researcher Open Source Practices, The Alan Turing Institute \- corresponding author  
  * Ben Thomas, Policy Research Fellow, University of Southampton  
  * Markus Haru, Senior Research Data Scientist, The Alan Turing Institute  
* **Workshop length** \- 120 mins  
* **Which theme does your Workshop align best to:** RSE as DRI   
* **In-person or online delivery** (checklist)  
  In-person  
* **Reviewing Submissions**: We need your help to review submissions. Would you be interested in learning more about becoming a reviewer?   
  YES  
* **Mentorship:** If your submission is accepted, would you like a mentor?  
  Yes

# Workshop Overview

**Introduction (15 minutes)**

* **Delivery method: via Powerpoint presentation and verbally for people in person and online**  
* Welcome and facilitator introduction (5 mins)  
  * Overview of workshop structure and expectations  
  * Present the questions the workshop will address  
* Brief participant introductions (name, role, institution, experience with open source) (10 mins in groups)

**Activity: Personal open source experience (20 mins)**

* **Delivery method: shared virtual sticky note board (either Zoom whiteboard or Miro), or shared notes document, and/or physical sticky notes in person. Participants will have the option to write private notes if they wish but this will reduce their ability to engage with the second part of the activity.**   
* Provide each participant with prompts for silent reflection (10 mins)  
  * "Briefly describe your first meaningful open source contribution"  
  * "What motivated you to contribute?"  
  * "What surprised you about the process?"  
  * "What barriers did you encounter getting started in open source?"  
  * "How was your contribution received or recognized?"  
  * "How has this experience affected your subsequent engagement with open source?"  
* Group categorisation of themes from open source contributions (10 mins)  
* Facilitation notes:   
  * Encourage participants who have never contributed to think about why they haven't and what prevented them  
  * For participants with extensive experience, suggest focusing on their most meaningful or challenging contribution, or their experiences contributing to upstreams projects for the first time  
  * Emphasize that all types of contributions are valid (not just code)

**Activity: Barrier Identification (20 minutes)**

* **Delivery method: shared virtual sticky note board (either Zoom whiteboard or Miro), or shared notes document, and/or physical sticky notes in person.**   
* Small group brainstorming (10 min): Each group identifies specific barriers to open source contribution in academia and prioritises them according to how   
  * These might either be from personal experience or structural challenges  
* Quick report back (10 min): Each group shares the top 3 priority barriers from their lists

**Break 5 mins (65 mins to this point)**

**Activity: Learning from existing practices (20 mins)**

* **Delivery method: via Powerpoint presentation and verbally for people in person and online, with an online shared notes document**  
* Lightning talks (5 min each): 3 participants share successful examples of open source contribution models in academic settings  
  * The Alan Turing Institute Open Source Service Area

  * One more?   
* Questions from the audience

**Activity: interventions (15 mins)**
