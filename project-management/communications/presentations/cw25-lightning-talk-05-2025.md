# Submission for a Collaborations Workshop Lightning Talk (2mins) at CW25 in May 2025

## Lightning Talk Title 
From open code to open contributions: exploring open source practices in academia

## Lightning Talk Abstract 
This lightning talk will provide a short overview of my survey and exploration of open source practices in academia as part of my SSI fellowship. 
The audience will be invited to take the survey and share it with their networks. 
The talk will also invite people to discuss the idea as part of the discussion and speedblogging session.

## Lightning Talk Theme
Research software / digital skills for future
Research Software Quality

## Anything else? 
If successful, ideally this talk would be scheduled before the discussion sessions so I could invite people to participate in a discussion session on the topic, but this is not essential.
