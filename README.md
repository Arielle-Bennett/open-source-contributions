## About this Repository
This repository is being maintained by Arielle Bennett, Senior Researcher in Open Source Practices at The Alan Turing Institute to track and share progress on her [Software Sustainability Institute Fellowship project](https://www.software.ac.uk/programmes/fellowship-programme): "From open code to open contributions".
This repository follows the recommendations and guidance provided in *[The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome)* handbook.

# Vision and Mission

- **Vision:** Improving the culture of open source contributions in academia
- **Mission:** Engaging researchers, RSEs, and other research technical professionals in considering culture change related to open source contributions in academia

## About

Currently, open source plays a critical role in research software, and is mandated by some funding sources.
However, these mandates vary widely in their clarity around exactly how they support open source and currently they are very focused on publishing code openly, rather than saupporting and recognising contributions to maintaining existing open source projects.
There are several groups across academia that are already encouraging people to support this maintenance activity which is critical for many open source research tools. 
This project intends to start asking the question "How to encourage more researchers and RSEs towards actively contributing to open source projects?"  

### Fellowship Aim
- Understand perceptions of, and barriers to, contributing to open source projects from researchers, RSEs and other research professionals
- Develop initial approach for improving contributions to open source 
- Run pilot plan and evaluate results 
- Share the process and results with the wider RSE community to help other organisations develop similar approaches
